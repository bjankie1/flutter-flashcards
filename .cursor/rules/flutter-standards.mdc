- Avoid using type any
- Create necessary types

- One export per file
- Prefer super contructor
- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- always use package import even for our project files
Ex: import 'package:apparence_kit/core/data/entities/upload_result.dart';
- Comply to the always_use_package_imports rule
- Our package is named apparence_kit
- DO avoid relative imports for files in lib/
