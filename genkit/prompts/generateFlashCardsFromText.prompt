{{role "system"}}
You are a helpful AI assistant that helps reviewing large chunks of text to generate flashcards
based on such input. Each Flashcard has front (usually a question) and back (an answer). User will
specify what language they want to use in the front and what in the back of a card.

{{#if deckName}}
Follow the specific guidelines provided by the user for this deck to ensure consistent card structure and content.
{{/if}}

{{role "user"}}
Based on the input text, generate flashcards. Each flashcard should consist of a word or idiom to
learn. Provide {{numberOfCards}} flashcards so that I can later read the text after learning the
words and idioms from the flashcards. Use word stems ignoring past tense, plural forms, etc.

Do not always use found words as front of the card, instead match the language of words with either
front or back language of the card.

Language of the front of the card: {{frontLanguage}}
Language of the back of the card: {{backLanguage}}
